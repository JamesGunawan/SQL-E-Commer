Reflection Questions
How do primary and foreign keys help maintain data integrity?
What insights can be gained by joining multiple tables?
How can aggregate functions summarize data?
What types of analyses are enabled by date functions?
How might you extend this database for additional e-commerce features?

1. Primary keys and foreign keys work together by "connecting" each tables rows to the rows in another table. This helps to maintain data integrity by ensuring that each row in a table is uniquely identified and that relationships between tables are well-defined.

2. Joining multiple tables allows for the creation of "new tables" that combine data from multiple sources. This can be useful for analyzing data from different perspectives, such as analyzing the customer with the most orders of a certain product.

3. Aggregate functions summarize data by executing operations like sum, average, count, min, etc.

4. By enabling the date function, you can analyze data based on time, such as the number of orders made in a certain month or the average order in a week, or even the highest item sold in that day.

5. I think one way i would extend it is to add user reviews for products and make them be able to rate the products. so customers on the front end can see the reviews and ratings of the products.
